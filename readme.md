# Tensorflow Image Detection 

Just a tiny example of how to use Tensorflow with React to 
detect objects from the user's webcam. 

## Getting Started

Simply a node application, so `npm install` then `npm run start` and you'll be up and running. 

## Caveats

Don't actually use this. I threw this together in an hour or two just for an example of how to use the API. I'm sure there's better ways to do nearly everything I've done here...
